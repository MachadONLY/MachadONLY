I have experience in infrastructure, networking, security, and the latest technologies like Kubernetes and containers. I'm passionate about DevOps and DevSecOps, always seeking ways to optimize operations and enhance security in complex environments.

I believe technology should be accessible to everyone, and I work to democratize knowledge and facilitate continuous learning in the professional environment. My mission is to make technological solutions simple and effective, creating a more collaborative and innovative space.

I'm here to share knowledge and promote a culture of information exchange because I believe individual growth strengthens collective success. Letâ€™s connect and explore how to transform technological challenges into growth opportunities together!

I have knowledge in development, CI/CD, and GitOps, with a focus on automation and process optimization. Always looking for practical and efficient solutions, applying DevOps best practices.
